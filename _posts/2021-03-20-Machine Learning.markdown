## Machine Learning Topics:
This area focuses on the algorithms that analyze data to make predictions.


### Supervised Learning:
This technique involves models training itself on labelled dataset.

- [Regression](#evidence)
- [Support Vector Machines](#evidence)
- [Decision Trees](#evidence)
- [Random Forests](#evidence)


### Unsupervised Learning:

- [Clustering](#evidence)
- [Principal Component Analysis](#evidence)

### Reinforcement Learning:

- [Reinforcement Learning][1]
- [Causality][2]


### Optimizating ML models:

Hyperparameter tuning is important for machine learning algorithms to enhance a model's performance. It is a configuration that is experimented by trial and error to discover 
the parameters that will result in the best predictions. [Hyper-parameter tuning][1]
- [Backpropagation][1]


### User Interface Tools For Learning:

This is an educational sandbox for begineers to learn fundamentals of machine learning intuitively. [Machine Learning Playground][1]
