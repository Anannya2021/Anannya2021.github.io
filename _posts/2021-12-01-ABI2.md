Designing for a modern and resilient analytics stack is not only about building for an intelligent data architecture via cloud native technologies or ensuring that an advanced analytics platform has a comprehensive set of data connectors with interactive data visualization tools.

First and foremost, a strong foundation in data calls for applying a business oriented mindset to identifying the capabilities a business is looking for. It is about setting out a sustainable business strategy to help deliver superior performance and drive sustainable and responsible growth.  Organizations today understand that to remain competitive, they need to continue their path to becoming data intelligent. It is necessary to define motivational triggers and review high impact use cases while ensuring awareness and alignment with business and IT stakeholders to achieve the intended results. Once the motivations, objectives and expected benefits are assessed, the next stage calls for a full assessment on the current analytics platform or digital data estate and its components both at a high level of understanding and a detailed level of evaluation.  

An effective data strategy is one that is aligned to the business drivers and capabilities. It is relevant and contextualized to the organization's needs while also being evolutionary in the sense that it continuously updates according to periodic reviews of progress.

Quantify benefit risk and dependencies

Prioritize and align and get consensus

Trying to make sense of overwhelming data is nothing short of confusion. Not all data is equally useful. Some are a distraction at best and a misleading source of information at worst. 

Executive sponsorship and leadership communication, commitment and involvement in the decision making process is equally important and required to ensure success. 

In my current set-up, the data and analytics team is responsible for building out data, data science and analytics as a core capability to help business become data intelligent. The key themes to the strategy are as follows : 

Delivering intelligent systems at scale by leveraging on big data and data science.

Driving assisted and predicitive decision-making by unlocking insights from deluge of customer and external data.

Progressing with better data with continued excellence through accessibility and continuous improvement.

Single source of truth with one version of facts
