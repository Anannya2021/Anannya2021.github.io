MLflow is designed to track models, model parameters and hyperpararmeters for reproducability. It is an open source project that we can easily install by running the following command in anaconda prompt : 

* `pip install mlflow` 

You should see this if its already installed (as in my case) :

Goal :  Run a simple example to train a linear regressio model and hen compare the models with different values for the parameters passed as arguments to the training model.

Dataset : Wine dataset from UCI [machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)

You can clone the MLflow repository via git clone https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow through GitBash :

Then, cd into the examples directory with your clone of MLflow.
