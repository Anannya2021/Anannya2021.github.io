A machine learning model is a function 𝑓(x; 𝜃) where 𝜃 is a vector of model parameters (e.g. the weights of a linear regression model or the encoded splits of a decision tree model). This function accepts an input vector x ∈ R 𝑝 and produces a real output (for regression) or probability of being in a specific class (for classification). Mathematical optimisation is the essential foundation of machine learning and AI and any optimization problem generally consists of 3 components : 

1) Objective function

2) Constraints

3) Hypothesis space 

It usually takes the form of min f(X); s.t g(X) <=0 ; h(X) =0
