MLflow is designed to track models, model parameters and hyperpararmeters for reproducability. It is an open source project that we can easily install by running the following command : 

* `pip install mlflow` in anaconda prompt. you should see this : 

Goal :  Run a simple example to train a linear regressio model and hen compare the models with different values for the parameters passed as arguments to the training model.

Dataset : Wine dataset from UCI [machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)
