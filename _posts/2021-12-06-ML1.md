MLflow is designed to track models, model parameters and hyperpararmeters for reproducability. It is an open source project that we can easily install by running the following command in anaconda prompt : 

* `pip install mlflow` 

You should see this if its already installed (as in my case) :

Goal :  A quick POC by running a simple example to train a linear regressio model and hen compare the models with different values for the parameters passed as arguments to the training model.

Dataset : Wine dataset from UCI [machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)

You can clone the MLflow repository via git clone https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow through GitBash :

Then, cd into the examples directory with your clone of MLflow.

Reproducing the code from examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine/train.py, we try out multiple values for the parameters, alpha and l1_ratio by passing them as arguments to train.py

MLflow will log the information about each experiment run and compare the models that are produced. To start MLflow, execute the command in anaconda prompt :

* `mlflow ui` 

Call up the url : http://localhost:5000. This is how the UI looked for me, with a list of experiments run and metrics used for comapring the models :
