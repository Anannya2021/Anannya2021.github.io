RNN, a class of deep learning method, is a technique used to predict consumer behaviour from their interaction history. Consumer history can be viewed as a sequence of events. 
It captures and holds important important clues that can be used for predictions. For example, we may want to find out the propensity of a customer to order within the next 7 days, 
from the time they engaged and viewed the product. 

Traditionally, feature engineering was applied on sequential data through machine learning models. In feature engineering, a vector of features are constructed from a given 
consumer history and this is provided as an input to a vector based machine learning model. Deciding on the exact choice of feature representation has decisive effects on a 
model's performance and it is a tedious and laborious work, so an alternative to circumvent this is to look towards recurrent neural networks as they work directly on sequences 
as inputs.
