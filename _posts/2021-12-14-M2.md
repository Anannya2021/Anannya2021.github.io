The curse of dimensionality phenomena is a problem that arises when a high-dimnesional dataset results in sparsity, where the volume of the space represented grows quickly. Unless data size grows exponentially in relation to the variables, classification and prediction models will fail, because the current data is insuffcient to provide a useful model across so many variables.
