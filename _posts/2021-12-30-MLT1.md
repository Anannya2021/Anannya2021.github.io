A/B experiments are an experimental methodology example of statistical hypothesis testing. There are two groups, primarily the test and control to which the product has been tested and the results are then compared to check if it is practical and statistically significant. The following steps are outlined for hypothesis testing: 

(A)Declare your null hypothesis (Ho)

(B)Declare your alternative hypothesis (Ha)

(C)State your assumptions about your dataset

(D)Set your significance level(alpha Î±) 

(E)Choose your test and Conduct your experiment

(F)Record observations/results

(G)Compute probability of your results

(H)Make a decision based on your p-value
