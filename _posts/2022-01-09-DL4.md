The principle of causality guides the language of nature and is the basis of scientific inquiry. It is a set of rules that describes the temporal relationship that must exist between 2 events, A and B. Deep Learning has the potential to estimate causal inference to new settings when the confounding is high-dimensional, non-linear and time varying.
