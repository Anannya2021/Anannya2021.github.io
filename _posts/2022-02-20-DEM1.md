title: "DEM1 : Data Processing Patterns ~ ETL to ELT"
date: 2022-02-17
excerpt: ETL processes are no longer enough to manage the diversity of data types and ingestion styles of the modern data landscape. Cloud driven ELT patterns enable for greater scalability and elasticity. In this blog, i investigate the key considerations for a shift to ELT ingestion patterns and the accompanying data management strategy for putting in place.

ETL is an integration pattern that involves the extraction of data from various sources on-premise, transforming and enriching it into a staging server and loading the data to a target destination such as a data warehouse or data lake. While it is commonly used for batch ingestion process on mostly structured data and legacy data architectures, it tends to create its own data silo for each production application, whether it is on premise or on cloud. ELT is preferred when there is data from website interactions, equipment sensors and social media streams
