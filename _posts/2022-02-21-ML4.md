title: "ML4 : Evaluating Machine Learning Platforms ~ Real Data, Practical Tooling "
date: 2022-02-21
excerpt: These days, there is no shortage of propreitary managed machine learning platforms. How do you find one that is a good fit for your enterprise? What are the key factors to consider when re-engineering decision making for gaining a competitive advantage?

A machine learning solution is made up of a number of services that include data management to clean and transform data, compute services to engineer features and train models, software engineering tools to orchestrate and schedule the workflow as well as dashboarding to visualize the results and interact with the data real-time. Building a platform and centralizing these components from scratch can be quite a challenging journey to undertake for most organizations in-house. Google published a schematic overview of the MLOps pipeline and clearly without a solid strategy to guide the adoption, a lot of things can fail along the way.

AutoML solutions thus become the next evolutionary step in response to these challenges as they are often pitched as being effcient and easier to use. I present some of the key highlights and lowlights of their capabilities from both cloud vendors and third-party solutions as they have attempted to abstract this complexity through managed machine learning services by focusing on key aspects of the core layers. 


* AWS Sagemaker<br><br>
* Google's AutoML<br><br>
* Alteryx<br><br>
* Dataiku<br><br>

If an organization wants the power and flexibility of their own MLOps architecture, then the following open source components can be used to set up the system.

* JupyterHub - shared notebook for team collaboration<br><br>
* Seldon - to productionize the models<br><br>
* MLFlow - to track experiments and models<br><br>
* Apache Airflow - to manage workflows and schedule tasks<br><br>
* Dash, Shiny - dashboarding tools
