title: "ML4 : Evaluating Machine Learning Platforms ~ Real Data, Practical Tooling "
date: 2022-02-21
excerpt: These days, there is no shortage of propreitary managed machine learning platforms. How do you find one that is a good fit for your enterprise? What are the key factors to consider when re-engineering decision making for gaining a competitive advantage?

A mmachine learning solution is made up of a number of services that include data management to clean and transform data, compute services to engineer features and train models, software engineering tools to orchestrate and schedule the workflow as well as dashboarding to visualize the results and interact with the data real-time. Building a platform and centralizing these components from scratch can be quite a challenging journey to undertake for most organizations in-house. Google published a schematic overview of the MLOps pipeline and clearly without a solid strategy to guide the design and implementation, a lot of things can fail along the way.

Cloud vendors have attempted to abstract this complexity through managed machine learning services by focusing on key aspects of the core layers. 

I will cover my thoughts by examining ML platforms provided by the cloud service providers as well as third-party solutions that are gaining in popularity : 


* AWS Sagemaker<br><br>
* Google's AI Platform - Vertex AI<br><br>
