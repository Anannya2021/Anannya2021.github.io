title: "AI5 : Explanability In AI ~ Frameworks for XAI"
date: 2022-03-28
excerpt: There is always a tension between accuracy and interpretability in using deep learning models. Explanaibility frameworks imposes and enforces the process of explanability while assessing model results with respect to biasedness and fairness.  
---

The approach in explainability covers a few dimensions, the primary being algorithmic transparency.  

Frameworks <TO DO>
1. LIME - Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations
  
2. SHAP - Shapely Additive exPlnations. This is a framework that adopts a game theory approach to AI explanability. Details of the frameowrk can be found in this research paper :
