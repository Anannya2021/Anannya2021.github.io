title: "AI4 : Machine Learning Intergrity ~ Is Zero Knowledge Proof The Way?"
date: 2022-03-28
excerpt: Zero Knowledge Proof protocols are an age old cryptographic method of allowing a prover to produce a short proof "p" that can convince a verifier

One of the key security concerns of machine learning models relate to their integrity. Although models such as neural networks achieve high accuracy, reproducing their results 
and validating those claims
