One of the key security concerns of machine learning models relate to their security. Data collaborations and partnerships amongst organizations have amplified data breaches. Protecting data requires controlling and monitoring access concurrently while disposing unused data and securing the remaining data through encryption, tokenization, masking.

Zero trust is a borrowed cybersecurity concept that is based on the premise that trust is never granted implicitly, rather it has to be continually evaluated. In today's context, AI based products and services are already ubiquitious and embedded in almost everything that we humans rely on.
