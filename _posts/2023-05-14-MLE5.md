excerpt: MLOps is an extended concept borrowed from DevOps in software engineering.

MLOps is all about a set of processes and framework that sets up reproducible machine learning pipelines to bring models into production.

While the early versions of open-source AutoML solutions originated from <a class="url" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.05557.pdf">academia</a>,they were limited in support for workflow steps that extended to feature extraction and engineering, model evaluation, deployment and monitoring. The recent wave of enterprise AutoML solutions are developed mostly by the major cloud providers are more comprehensive while offering scalability, flexibility and explanability capabilities. Unlike a mainstream system design where tasks are run in a monolith fashion, these models abstract easch part of the ML  workflow into an independent service as it scales. 

I present a comparative study on some AutoML solutions from both cloud vendors and third-party solutions as they have attempted to abstract this complexity through managed machine learning services by focusing on key aspects of the core layers in terms of their functionalities and perfomance on experiments involving high dimensional dataset and multi-clas problems.

Google introduced its Cloud AutoML framework in 2018 to offer automated machine learning capabilites to non ML experts and democratize data science. It automates the process of algorithm selection wherein the citizen data scientist does not need to choose which model is appropiate and build the framework. They can focus on the busines problem without getting lost with the technicalities or expertise to get an optimized model. Inset is a schematic overview of the MLOps pipeline from Google cloud. On the other hand, Databricks creates and evaluates models that are constructed from open source components - from the scikit-learn (classification and regression models), XG-boost and LightGBM packages and integrated into machine learninig pipelines.
