	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Anannya here üëã</span> and I am a passionate AI Researcher, Data Scientist and an educator.</p>
	<p>This is my personal blog for all things data related - concepts, thought articles and experimental code examples. <span itemprop="title">My career experiences span across the spectrum from Data Engineering to Advanced Analytics and Deep Learning.</span> 
	I hold the view that creating high quality commercial analytics and machine learning solutions requires unification from a broad field of knowledge - from architecture and best practices in data engineering to distributed computing. 
		
	<span itemprop="address" itemscopeitemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Address">A little extra about me - I tend to fill up my spare time with blogposts and books that are not all geeky these days...</p>
	
	<p>This site you are browsing now is built from scratch and made with love using Github and Jekyll templates toolchain.<span itemprop="title">It also functions as an aggregator for some of my work. All opinions expressed here are of my own. I welcome relevant and respectful comments</span>.</p>
